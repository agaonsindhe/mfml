For this run, starting from the point \((-5.6031, -6.3526)\) with \(130\) iterations, the algorithm converged to the point \((-3.93020495 \times 10^{-13}, -2.59573908)\) with a function value of approximately \(-3.618\). This convergence indicates that, similar to the previous run, the algorithm successfully found a local minimum with a significant negative value.

This result reaffirms the function \(C(x, y) = 3x^2 + 2y^2 + 20\cos(x)\cos(y)\)'s complex landscape, characterized by multiple minima due to its trigonometric components. The convergence to a point with a substantial negative value suggests that the algorithm has again located a deep local minimum within the function's domain.

Given the specifics of the function and the nature of gradient descent, which is sensitive to initial conditions and can converge to local minima, the outcome here is consistent with the expectations for this type of optimization problem. The algorithm did not fail to converge; rather, it effectively found a significant local minimum, evidenced by the convergence to a specific point with a corresponding function value.

Thus, based on this run's data, the algorithm converged to what appears to be a substantial local minimum, similar to the previous run. Determining whether this point represents the global minimum would require a broader analysis across the function's entire domain or employing optimization techniques designed to escape local minima and explore more of the function's landscape.
